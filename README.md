## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simplified version of the Titanic dataset, containing information about passengers, their demographics, and survival status.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code files.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
 

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
    ```

 

## Usage

- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data analysis and model development.
 

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent various preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and standardizing features.

## Machine Learning Model

A machine learning model was trained on the preprocessed data to predict passenger survival. Different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning were explored for optimal performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Visualizations are included for better understanding.

## Results

Share insights into the results obtained from the machine learning model. Provide visualizations and interpretations of key findings.
